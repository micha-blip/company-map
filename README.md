This project aims to cluster the descriptions of life-science-related companies and organizations operating in Berlin according to those obtained from their websites.
If the companies describe themselves similarly, they should be closer. This is sometimes the case, as in the case of blood-tumor diagnostics or radiotherapeutics. 
Some companies are very vague about their roles, which affects the embedding.
